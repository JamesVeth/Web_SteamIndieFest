## About
Welcome to the Steam Indie Fest Festival Website repository! This is a mock website designed for the Steam Indie Fest. 
This project is a web application created to showcase indie games featured on Steam, during the festival.

## Features
- Browse a featured list of indie games via a scrolling carousel
- View a schedule of events taking place on the live stage
- Register to book tickets to the event, via a email reservation system
- Contact the organizers via a contact form
- Responsive website, with a stylish navigation pop out menu, and intricately sized for many devices

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Node.js (In the future) for backend registration and contact form processing

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/JamesVeth/Web_SteamIndieFest.git`

2. Make changes and commit:
   - Make your changes to the files.
   - Stage your changes:  
     `git add .`
   - Commit your changes:  
     `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`
     
3. Push your changes to main:  
     `git push origin main`

4. Pull the latest changes (if someone else made changes):  
     `git pull origin main`
   
6. Reset to the latest version from the main branch (if you need to discard local changes):  
     `git reset --hard origin/main`
     

## Usage
